### Yes! it is on-line. :)
_The time I checked_

https://browserspeechsynthesis.onrender.com
<br><br>
**language: Portuguese - Brazil**
<br><br>

### How it works

No requirements needed

Just open the **_index.html_** file

Apparentely it doesn't need internet connection to work, it probably has in-built packages and libraries in the browser
<br><br>

### Extra
I almost forgot. This project works in portuguese only
but you can change the language where:
```javascript
const language = 'pt-BR';
```
or you can just search for **"language"**
<br><br>

**HAVE FUN!**
