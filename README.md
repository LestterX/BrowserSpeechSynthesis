### Yes! it is on-line. :)
_Last time I checked_

https://browserspeechsynthesis.onrender.com
<br><br>
**language: Portuguese - Brazil**

### How it works

No requirements needed at the first place

Just open the **_/public/index.html_** file

**OR**

You can start the Socket.IO server with
```shell
yarn start or npm start
```

Apparentely it doesn't need internet connection to work after installation, it probably has built-in packages and libraries in the browser

### Modules
- Synth (Probably built-in package in the browser)

### Packages (socket server only)
- Socket.IO
- Express
- CORS
- Nodemon

### Extra
I almost forgot. This project works in portuguese only
but you can change the language where:
```javascript
const language = 'pt-BR';
```
**/public/script.js file** <br>
or you can just search for **"language"**
<br><br>

**HAVE FUN!**
